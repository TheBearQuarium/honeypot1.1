# honeypot
Honeypot is a native, cross-platform application that helps users manage personal finance in an easy and fun way by linking game-play to monetary savings. Through in-game microtransactions, users deposit money into their savings account by purchasing supplies for their virtual pet.

The user interface is a pet-care game that triggers ACH transfers between a userâ€™s checking and savings accounts. The happier your pet, the bigger your savings.
